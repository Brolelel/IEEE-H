# 2024-IEEE-MP3-Project

A simple media player with bluetooth support using an ESP32, LCD display, audio driver, battery, and button controls.

This is a part of the Brigham Young University IEEE student branch 2024-2025 project.

There are 4 outcomes we hope to accomplish with this project. These are:

    Develop an understanding of KiCAD and PCB design, including footprint design, schematic development, and design rules.
    Learn embedded programming by using FreeRTOS and C to program an ESP32 microcontroller to process media files and control its input and output functions.
    Acquire skill in how to use CAD softwares to design an appropriate chassis for electrical components.
    Become confident and consistent in electrical engineering project documentation.

We anticipate this project will be exciting, challenging, and provide participating students an opportunity to grow their engineering skills outside of a classroom setting.
